        <h1>About $POUCH</h1>
        <p>He didn’t fall from a tree—he was yeeted from the blockchain during a liquidity rug at 3am.</p>
        <p>Birthed in a gas war, fermented in a wallet with no seed phrase, and raised by airdropped trash tokens, this apple wasn’t grown—he was summoned. One part fruit, two parts fury, and 100% unregulated.</p>
        <p>They said he’d never make it.<br>Said apples couldn’t pump.<br>Said juice doesn’t belong on chain.</p>
        <p>But he didn’t listen.<br>He was too busy squeezing.</p>
        <p>His pouch isn’t just a snack—it’s a weapon. Packed with raw chart energy, enough natural pump to scare a stablecoin. Every squeeze sends shockwaves through the timeline. Candles? Green. Charts? Moist. Traders? Horny.</p>
        <p>He doesn’t count macros. He counts wallets.<br>He doesn’t offer financial advice. He offers pressure.</p>
        <p>Now he roams the BASE chain shirtless, vein-popping, coin-flipping, and absolutely cooked off his own supply.</p>
        <p>If you’re reading this, it’s already too late.<br>You’re deep in the orchard now.</p>
        <p>Welcome to $POUCH.<br>Every squeeze leaves a stain.</p>
